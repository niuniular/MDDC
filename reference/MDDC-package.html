algorithm for adverse event identification.
For a certain time period, the spontaneous reports can be extracted from
the safety database and depicted as an
\(I \times J\) contingency table, where:
\(I\) denotes the total number of adverse events (AEs).
\(J\) denotes the total number of drugs or vaccines.
The cell counts \(n_{ij}\) represent the total number of reported cases
corresponding to the \(j\)-th drug/vaccine and
the \(i\)-th AE. We are interested in identifying which
(AE, drug or vaccine) pairs are signals.
Signals refer to potential adverse events that may be caused by a
drug or vaccine.
In the contingency table setting, signals refer to the cells where
\(n_{ij}\) is abnormally higher than the expected values.
The Detecting Deviating Cells (DDC) algorithm, originally proposed by
Rousseeuw and Bossche (2018), was designed for outlier identification in
multivariate datasets. However, the original DDC algorithm assumes
multivariate normality of the data, with cutoffs based on this assumption.
In contrast, the MDDC algorithm is designed for the discrete nature
of adverse event data in pharmacovigilance, which clearly do not follow
a multivariate normal distribution.
Our Modified Detecting Deviating Cells (MDDC) algorithm has the following
characteristics:
It is easy to compute.
It considers AE relationships.
It uses data-driven cutoffs.
It is independent of the use of ontologies.
The MDDC algorithm consists of five steps. The first two steps identify
univariate outliers via cutoffs, and the next three steps
evaluate the signals using AE correlations. More details can be found in the
MDDC algorithm documentation.
