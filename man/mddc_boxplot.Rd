\usage{
mddc_boxplot(
  contin_table,
  col_specific_cutoff = TRUE,
  separate = TRUE,
  if_col_cor = FALSE,
  cor_lim = 0.8,
  coef = 1.5,
  num_cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{contin_table}{A data matrix of an \eqn{I} x \eqn{J} contingency table
with row (adverse event) and column (drug or vaccine) names. Please first 
check the input contingency table using the function
\code{check_and_fix_contin_table()}.}

\item{col_specific_cutoff}{Logical. In the second step of the algorithm,
whether to apply boxplot method to the standardized Pearson residuals of
the entire table, or within each drug column. Default is \code{TRUE}, that
is within each drug column (column specific cutoff). \code{FALSE} indicates
applying boxplot method on residuals of the entire table.}

\item{separate}{Logical. In the second step of the algorithm, whether to
separate the standardized Pearson residuals for the zero cells and non zero
cells and apply boxplot method separately or together.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{if_col_cor}{Logical. In the third step of the algorithm, whether to use
column (drug or vaccine) correlation or row (adverse event) correlation. 
Default is \code{FALSE}, that is using the adverse event correlation. 
\code{TRUE} indicates using drug or vaccine correlation.}

\item{cor_lim}{A numeric value between (0, 1). In the third step,
what correlation threshold should be used to select ``connected''
adverse events. Default is 0.8.}

\item{coef}{A numeric value or a list of numeric values. If a single numeric
value is provided, it will be applied uniformly across all columns of the
contingency table. If a list is provided, its length must match the number
of columns in the contingency table, and each value will be used as the
coefficient for the corresponding column.}

\item{num_cores}{Number of cores used to parallelize the MDDC
Boxplot algorithm. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{boxplot_signal} returns the signals identified in the
second step.
1 indicates signals, 0 for non signal.
\item \code{corr_signal_pval} returns the p values for each cell in the
contingency table in the fifth step, when the \eqn{r_{ij}} values are mapped
back to the standard normal distribution.
\item \code{corr_signal_adj_pval} returns the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted
p values for each cell in the fifth step. We leave here an option for the
user to decide whether to use \code{corr_signal_pval} or
\code{corr_signal_adj_pval}, and what threshold for p values should be
used (for example, 0.05). Please see the example below.

step 2 of the algorithm.

\examples{
# using statin49 data set as an example
data(statin49)

# apply the mddc_boxplot
boxplot_res <- mddc_boxplot(statin49)

# signals identified in step 2 using boxplot method
signal_step2 <- boxplot_res$boxplot_signal

# signals identified in step 5 by considering AE correlations
# In this example, cells with p values less than 0.05 are
# identified as signals
signal_step5 <- (boxplot_res$corr_signal_pval < 0.05) * 1
